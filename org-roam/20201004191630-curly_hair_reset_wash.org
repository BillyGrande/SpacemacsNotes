#+title: Curly Hair Reset Wash

Reset wash is a vital step of curly hair [[file:20201004185945-curly_hair_routine_steps.org][routine]]. For reset washing we need a shampoo with sulfates, but no silicones. The reason is that sulfates will help us to remove build-up silicones from our old habits.

We use the sulfates shampoo only one time and then we proceed normally with the routine. We can use it in later times, if we think that our hair have build up.
